# FAQ

## Where is the comment section?
This website does not have a comment section and won't get some in the future.
While I'm open for feedback and think discussion is very valuable, personal
blogs are a bad place for this in general and only attract bots and trolls.
Feel free to drop me an [email]({{ .Site.Params.email }}) if you have comments,
(constructive) criticism or just want to say hi.

## Tabs or Spaces?
Spaces.

## Vim or Emacs?
[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/). Unless you need Emacs's Org-mode.

## Best IDE?
[Unix](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/)
