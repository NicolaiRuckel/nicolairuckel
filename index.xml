Even non-events like information on the song that was currently playing resulted in a pop-up notification. At some point I got really annoyed by all those pop-up notifications and replaced all of them with badges on the dock icon or in the status bar. This also had the advantage that I could leave my laptop for while, come back and did not miss anything important since all notifications persisted the whole time.</description></item></channel></rss>
