This is my personal website where I write about computer science related stuff
that I do in my free time.

[Github]({{ .Site.Params.github }}). Feel free to reuse them if not stated

# FAQ

## Where is the comment section?
This website does not have a comment section and won't get one in the future.
While I'm open for feedback and think discussion is very valuable, personal
blogs are a bad place for this in general and only attract bots and trolls.
Feel free to drop me an [email]({{ .Site.Params.email }}) if you have comments,
(constructive) criticism or just want to say hi.

## Tabs or Spaces?
Spaces.
